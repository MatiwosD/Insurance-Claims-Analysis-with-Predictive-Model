# Insurance Claims Analysis

This project aims to perform a detailed analysis of insurance claims data. The analysis focuses on data quality checks, data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive meaningful insights that can help in improving marketing strategies, attracting new clients, and optimizing insurance products.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. 

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/insurance-claims-analysis.git
   cd insurance-claims-analysis
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data Quality Checks and Data Cleaning

### Data Quality Checks

The `DataQualityCheck` class in `src/data_quality_check.py` performs basic data quality checks such as loading the data, displaying basic information, and checking for missing values.

### Data Cleaning

The `DataCleanProcessing` class in `src/data_clean_processing.py` handles data cleaning by removing columns with more than 50% missing values and filling remaining missing values with appropriate statistics (mode for categorical and median for numerical).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA is performed in `notebooks/EDA.ipynb`, which includes:
- Loading and cleaning the data
- Generating a correlation matrix
- Visualizing the correlation matrix with a heatmap

## Unit Tests

Unit tests for data quality checks and data cleaning are provided in the `tests` directory. These tests ensure the robustness and correctness of the implemented methods.

To run the tests, use the following command:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Continuous Integration

This project includes unit tests that can be integrated with CI/CD pipelines to ensure code quality and reliability.
